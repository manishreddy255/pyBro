# now This is python and we will start

# now we have to print hello

# print("hello")


# variable = a container for a value. Behaves as a container for some
#     value

# name = "Bro"
# print("hello" + name)
# print(type(name))

# you can join variable as long as they are of same data type

# name = "manish"
# listing = "hey this is listing"
# print(name + listing)
# you can do this

# now we will use another one with other data type
# dating = 78
# print(name + dating)
# you can't do this

# you can't concatenate two things of differeent type in python
# you can only do it after changing the type of the variable
# with type casting
# in this the data of one type is changed to another type
# age = 34
# print("hey how are you my age is :" + str(age))

#This is what you call a float data type

# height = 237.79
# print(height)
# print(type(height))
# print("your height is : " + str(height))

#boolean data type

# human = True
# animal = False
#
# print(animal)
# print(type(animal))
# print("Ar eyou a human ?: " + str(animal))

#multiple assignment in python
# assigning multiple variables at a tim

# name = "manish"
# age = 25
# attractive = True
# print(name)
# print(attractive)
# print(age)

# name, age, attractive = "manish", 78, True
#
# print(name, age, attractive)
#
# spongeBob = hermit = bunny = 78
#
# print(spongeBob)
# print(hermit)
# print(bunny)

#useful methods for strings

name = 'manish'

# print(len(name))
# print(name.find("m"))
# print(name.capitalize()) # emits copy with capitalized string
# print(name.upper())
# print(name.lower())
# print(name.isdigit()) it can be used to know if the thing is a string or not
# print(name.isalpha()) if the string contain all strings
# print(name.count("a"))
# print(name.replace('i', 'ki'))
# print(name*78) with this you can print it multiple times

#********** Type casting ****************
# it is ability to convert one data type to another
# x = 1
# y = 2.0
# z = "ama"
# k = "89"
#
# # int(y) # this just emits something and doesn't change anything
# y = int(y)
# print(x, y, z*3)
# k = int(k)
# print(k*3)
# print(type(x))
# print(type(y))
# print(type(z))

# ************ input accepting and performing op's **************

# doing = input("what are you doing ?")
# print("so you are " + doing)
#
# #important point whenever you give something in input
# # it is always a string and you can only type cast it to something
# #else
#
# age = int(input("hey what is your age ?: "))
# print(age, type(age))
# print(" So your age is " + str(age) + " then you can  who ever you want")
