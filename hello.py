# now This is python and we will start

# now we have to print hello

# print("hello")


# variable = a container for a value. Behaves as a container for some
#     value

# name = "Bro"
# print("hello" + name)
# print(type(name))

# you can join variable as long as they are of same data type

# name = "manish"
# listing = "hey this is listing"
# print(name + listing)
# you can do this

# now we will use another one with other data type
# dating = 78
# print(name + dating)
# you can't do this

# you can't concatenate two things of differeent type in python
# you can only do it after changing the type of the variable
# with type casting
age = 34
print("hey how are you my age is :" + str(age))
